    <p>It looks like the language for you is........ <span class="landing"></span> </p>

  <div class="ruby">
    <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><img src="images/ruby.jpeg" alt="Ruby Logo"></a>
    <h1>Ruby</h1>
    <p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional programming with imperative
      programming. He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,” in a way that mirrors life. Building on this, he adds:
      <br>
      "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body".</p>

    <div class="rust">
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"> <img src="images/rust.png" alt="Rust Logo"></a>
      <h1>Rust</h1>
      <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++ but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.Rust was originally
        designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo layout or browser engine and the Rust compiler. The compiler is free and
        open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License 2.0.
        <br>
        Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016.</p>

      <div class="swift">
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/"><img id="swiftlogo" src="images/swift.jpeg" alt="Swift Logo"></a>
        <h1>Swift</h1>
        <p>Swift is a fantastic way to write software, whether it’s for phones, desktops, servers, or anything else that runs code. It’s a safe, fast, and interactive programming language that combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom
          from the wider Apple engineering culture and the diverse contributions from its open-source community. The compiler is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either.
          Swift is friendly to new programmers. It’s an industrial-quality programming language that’s as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. Writing Swift code in a playground lets you experiment with code and see the results immediately,
          without the overhead of building and running an app.Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:
          <ul>
            <li> Variables are always initialized before use.</li>
            <li>Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors.</li>
            <li>Integers are checked for overflow.</li>
            <li>Optionals ensure that nil values are handled explicitly.</li>
            <li>Memory is managed automatically.</li>
            <li>Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures.</li>
          </ul>
          Swift code is compiled and optimized to get the most out of modern hardware. The syntax and standard library have been designed based on the guiding principle that the obvious way to write your code should also perform the best. Its combination
          of safety and speed make Swift an excellent choice for everything from “Hello, world!” to an entire operating system.Swift combines powerful type inference and pattern matching with a modern, lightweight syntax, allowing complex ideas to be
          expressed in a clear and concise manner. As a result, code is not just easier to write, but easier to read and maintain as well.
          <br>
          Swift has been years in the making, and it continues to evolve with new features and capabilities. Our goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.</p>
